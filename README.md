# Data-Warehousing

Data Warehouses are old technologies, but still very effective. For some time, people thought they would go away to make room for more mordern concepts like data lakes, which can handle data in a greater variety and in a greater volumn. However, instead of disappearing, data warehouses are still a big part of any company due to their ease of use. 

A even though they require some data modelling and can only work with structured data, data warehouses are well stablished in the market, can be connected to many BI Tools and offer answers to many business problems and decisions. Therefore, still an absolutely necessary concept for data engineers.
